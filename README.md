4. Checking the validity of the itemset by checking minimmum support condition.
5. Pruning the itemsets that does not fit the condition.
6. Implementing Apriori function.
7. Then finding the subsets of previous itemsets.
8. Finding its association rules.
9. Printing the final association rules or frequent itemsets from the transactions.
